# 2025_Region8_AnalysisTool
R Shiny Application (under active development) designed to assist EPA and 
Region 8 states and tribal nations with accessing, analyzing and visualizing
Water Quality Portal (WQP) data.  

This R Shiny application will include and expand on the functionality included 
in the 2024_Region8_AnalysisTool 
(https://github.com/USEPA/2024_Region8_AnalysisTool). Additionally, this 
version of the tool is being redesigned/rebuilt using the Golem Framework. 


## Open-Source Code Policy

Effective August 8, 2016, the [OMB Mandate: M-16-21; Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf) applies to new custom-developed code created or procured by EPA consistent with the scope and applicability requirements of Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Federal Source Code Policy. In general, it states that all new custom-developed code by Federal Agencies should be made available and reusable as open-source code.

The EPA specific implementation of OMB Mandate M-16-21 is addressed in the [System Life Cycle Management Procedure](https://www.epa.gov/irmpoli8/policy-procedures-and-guidance-system-life-cycle-management-slcm). EPA has chosen to use GitHub as its version control system as well as its inventory of open-source code projects. EPA uses GitHub to inventory its custom-developed, open-source code and generate the necessary metadata file that is then posted to code.gov for broad reuse in compliance with OMB Mandate M-16-21.
